## Introduction
The CAPTCHA Secure Login Page project aims to enhance the security of web-based applications by implementing a CAPTCHA service within the login and registration process. CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a challenge-response test used to determine whether the user is human or not, thus protecting the application from automated attacks.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The login and registration pages are designed to be intuitive and easy to use.
- **Robust CAPTCHA Service**: A strong CAPTCHA service is integrated into the login page to ensure that only human users can access the application.
- **Secure Authentication**: By implementing CAPTCHA, the application enhances user authentication, reducing the risk of automated attacks such as brute force login attempts.
- **Responsive Design**: The web interface is built to be responsive, providing a consistent experience across different devices and screen sizes.
